# semi-analytical

Original semi-analytical formulation makes 1D assumption to the diffusion of mass from the interface to the center of the matrix. 
This branch commits to re-formulate the semi-analytical method to implement the 3D assumption as originally conceived by Pruess et al. This commit assumes the matrix is made up of rectangular slabs or cubes.
